Complete Playwright test automation course with TypeScript. Best practices, API testing, Page Objects, Advanced features - By Udemy

Description
Playwright - test automation framework developed by Microsoft. Modern, highly customizable and reliable.

This class covers all fundamental concepts of the framework. We begin from scratch, starting with setup and configuration and then a hands-on framework overview to familiarize yourself with the environment. Then from lesson to lesson, we slowly increase complexity. All lessons have a logical progression and are connected. The next lesson in the section builds up a new concept on top of what was learned in the previous lesson. This is also related to the code demonstrated in the class. We will have two test applications, and slowly over the course will add more and more code uncovering new topics.

How to follow the class
Watch all lessons in the order they have been published. Write the code from the class along with me. If needed, pause the video to complete the code. Practicing - is the best way to learn. Also, I would recommend watching the lessons in full-screen mode because sometimes the text on the screen can be small and hard to read. If you skip lessons or watch them not in order, be ready that you may have a feeling of a knowledge gap, or that something is not clear.

What you will learn:

How to install Playwright from scratch as a new independent project or add to an existing front-end application project.

JavaScript Fundamentals in case you are a beginner to programming.

How to run tests using the command line interface, UI mode, Playwright extension, and debug tests

How to organize tests, structure tests, use test hooks

HTML terminology, locator syntax rules, and Playwright best practices to locate web elements.

Different types of assertions, how auto-waiting concept works, and how to configure different timeouts.

How to work with different UI components, such as input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, lists, tooltips, dialog boxes, date pickers, web tables, iFrames, sliders, drag and drop.

What is the Page Object Model. How to organize test framework code with Page Objects. Recommended architecture for Page Object model with Playwright

How to work with APIs: API mocking, API requests, intercept API calls, shared storage state, API authentication

Multiple advanced topics: fixtures, global setup and teardown, parallel execution, test tags, test retries, visual testing, mobile device emulation, reporters, environment variables, and test execution in Docker container.

By the end of the class, you'll be familiar with all important Playwright concepts to be able to automate pretty much any web application.
